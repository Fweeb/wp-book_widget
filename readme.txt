A simple widget for adding links to your books for sale on sites like Amazon, Kobo, Nook, etc.

  * Amazon
  * Nook
  * Kobo
  * iBooks
  * Google Play Books

A widget for that book appears in your sidebar. You can add as many book widgets as you would like.

== Installation ==
1. Download the latest version from GitHub
2. Upload the ZIP file to your web host
3. Decompress the ZIP file in your WordPress Plugins directory
4. Activate Book Widget from the Plugins section of your WordPress install
5. Add a widget for each book you want on your sidebar.
