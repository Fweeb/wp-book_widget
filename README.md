# Book Widget Plugin for WordPress

This is a really simple WordPress plugin that adds a sidebar widget. The widget has your book's title, an image of your book cover, and links to places to purchase the book at various retailers (i.e. Amazon, Kobo, Nook, iTunes, etc.)

## Current features

You can upload your book cover image (or choose it from the WordPress Media Library if you've already uploaded it), enter the book title, and add links to 5 separate vendors:

* Amazon
* Nook
* Kobo
* iBooks
* Google Play Books

A widget for that book appears in your sidebar with links to all of the vendors you entered. You can add as many book widgets as you would like.

## Possible future features

* Inclusion of book price
* Possibly the ability to add additional vendors
* Customizable image size for the book cover image
* Modifications to aesthetics

## Installation

Eventually, you'll be able to install right from within WordPress. However, while in development, you do it this way:

1. Download the latest version from GitHub (here)
2. Upload the ZIP file to your web host
3. Decompress the ZIP file in your WordPress Plugins directory
4. Activate Book Widget from the Plugins section of your WordPress install
5. Add a widget for each book you want on your sidebar.
